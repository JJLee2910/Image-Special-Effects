# Image-Special-Effects
**University Assignment Project**
This project focuses on implementing various image pre-processing techniques to enhance and extract meaningful information from images. By leveraging the power of **SIFT** (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), **Convex Hulls**, **Canny Edge detection**, and **Hough Lines algorithm**, this project aims to improve image quality, feature extraction, and object detection.

# Key Features:
1. **Eye Detection**: This project includes a cascade classifier implementation for accurate and efficient eye detection. By leveraging the power of machine learning, it enables the identification and localization of eyes within images, providing a crucial component for applications such as gaze tracking, eye recognition, and driver fatigue detection.

2. **Feature Extraction using SIFT**: The Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm is utilized to extract robust and distinctive features from images. These features serve as key points for image matching, object recognition, and image registration tasks. By employing SIFT, this project enables efficient and accurate feature extraction, enhancing the overall performance of computer vision applications.

3. **Traffic Cone Detection using Convex Hulls**: The Convex Hull algorithm is employed to detect and extract the boundaries of traffic cones within images. By analyzing the convex hulls of the detected objects, this project enables efficient detection and segmentation of traffic cones, which is vital for applications such as autonomous driving, road safety, and traffic monitoring.

4. **Line Features Extraction using Hough Lines**: The Hough Lines algorithm is implemented to detect and extract straight lines from images. This feature is particularly useful for tasks such as lane detection, road mapping, and industrial inspection. By leveraging Hough Lines, this project will able to perform the following task:

    • To identify the lines on the road.

    • To identify the direction of the lines.

    • To detect whether the lines are white or yellow in color.
5. **Image Segmentation**: This project segments the important parts of an image from the background, aiding in object detection, accident prevention, lane change safety, and accurate parking. Detected obstacles are highlighted in the plotted image, while green lines indicate areas to avoid for the car..
